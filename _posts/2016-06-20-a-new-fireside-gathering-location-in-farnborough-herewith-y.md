Thanks for signing up. If you have not yet done so please do [here][0].

We have decided to play in the Standard format. My sincere apologies if you have chosen your team based on Wild format and written out wild decks on the registration form. You can edit your character choice on Battlefy.

**We now have some Hearthstone goodies for the winner worth Â£30! **

The official start time is 11am. Please come along earlier to sign in. We will decide on what type of tournament to have when we know how many participants are coming. We may have a best of three, seeded double elimination with fewer numbers. If lots of people sign up then no problem, single game seeded double elimination! You will be asked what your highest rank has ever been in order to be seeded, so please be honest. My highest is only 14 :)  
Please email me if you have any questions. amidstbinary@gmail.com

To participate in the tournament you will need to know how to play and be able to submit a registration form detailing what decks you intend on using.   
Spectators and beginners are very welcome, you can learn some great tips by watching and playing friendly games with others.   
Farnborough Fireside Extravaganza will be held on July 9th at the Farnborough Community Centre from 11am to 5pm.
